On my personal projects, the script below reminds me to update my changelog:

```shell
#!/bin/sh
exec < /dev/tty
while true; do
	read -p "Have you updated the changelog? (y/n) " response
	
	if [[ "$response" ==  "y" ]] || [[ "$response" == "Y" ]]; then
		exit 0
	else 
		echo >&2 "Please run '$ codelog new <NAME>' to record the changes made"
		exit 1
	fi
done
```

Script is placed in hooks subdirectory of the Git directory (**project_dir/.git/.hooks**).
